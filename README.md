Project Title:
Mars Rover Simulation

Project Description:
This project is a Python-based simulation of a Mars Rover navigating a grid-based terrain. The Rover can move forward, turn left, and turn right, while avoiding obstacles and staying within the boundaries of the grid.

Example Usage:
1. Enter the initial direction (N, S, E, or W).
2. Provide a sequence of commands (M, L, R) to control the Rover.
3. Observe the status report after each move.
4. To quit the simulation, enter 'q' when prompted.

Features:
- Simulate the movement of a Mars Rover on a grid-based terrain.
- Commands include moving forward, turning left, and turning right.
- Obstacle detection prevents the Rover from colliding with obstacles.
- Status reports provide the current position and facing direction.
